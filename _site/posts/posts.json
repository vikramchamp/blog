The graph does not bring out the key changes of the labor force highlighted in the lead-in. There is no LFPR data in the graph, only labor force percentages by age buckets. Furthermore, the age ranges described don’t match the age buckets in the graph.\r\nData is provided as a table below the graph, without any indication of units. This is difficult to read & relate to as a total visualization.\r\nLack of proper axes and labels - The x-axis is not labeled and there is no y-Axis.\r\nThe median age lines are using the discrete x-axis scale (age range) to attempt to represent two continuous data points (median age), which is incorrect & unclear. Furthermore, having these lines intersect with the line graphs does not provide any helpful visual insight.\r\nAesthetics\r\nTick marks are shown even though the x axis is categorical in scale.\r\nChart is pixelated - Image quality is not addressed properly.\r\nIt is hard to read the line graph with points representing age buckets.\r\nSuggestions for Graphical Presentation\r\nThe following table summarizes the key changes recommended to the initial visualization:\r\nAspect\r\nCritique\r\nRecommendation\r\nClarity\r\nThe lead-in statement and visualization are not synchronized.\r\nGiving priority to the lead-in statement, the data used should consist of both labor force percentages as well as LFPR percentages for the specific age groups identified in the lead-in statement.\r\nClarity\r\nData is provided as a table below the graph, without any indication of units.\r\nThe data should firstly be visually represented as part of the chart and not as a separate table below the chart. Also, there should be clear units of measure stated.\r\nClarity\r\nLack of proper axes and labels\r\nThe chart should have a clear x-axis and y-axis, with appropriate labels and units of measure. There should also be a dual axis to represent the LPFR separately from the labor force percentages.\r\nClarity\r\nIncorrect usage of the median age lines.\r\nThere is no need to try force-fitting median age lines on the chart, especially when the axes do not have age as a unit of measure. Providing these two numbers can be done via a simple lead-in statement.\r\nAesthetics\r\nTick marks are shown even though the x axis is categorical in scale.\r\nTick marks are not necessary as the x axis is categorical in scale.\r\nAesthetics\r\nChart is pixelated.\r\nImage quality must be taken into consideration when publishing a visualization.\r\nAesthetics\r\nIt is hard to read the line graph with points representing age buckets.\r\nThere should be light grid lines on the chart to make it easy for the reader to read the line graphs in relation to the axes.\r\nSketch of proposed visualization\r\n\r\nKey characteristics of proposed visualization:\r\nFirstly, the axes need to be properly provided. A dual axis setup is proposed. The first y-axis will show the labor force % while the 2nd y-axis to chart the LFPR %.\r\nTo clearly relate to the lead-in statement, the data in the visualization has to be grouped clearly into the appropriate age range buckets. This will enable the reader to immediately read and relate to the changes described in the lead-in statement for the time window of 2009 to 2019.\r\nBars to represent the changes of the labor force percentages of each age group across the years.\r\nTo complement the bars, line graph should be used to show how the LFPR is changing across the years per age group. This will enable visual clarity and bring out the relationship between the two metrics in one glance.\r\nPreparing the Proposed Visualization with Tableau\r\nData Preparation\r\nThe first observation of the data source is that the table directly downloaded from MOM site is heavily formatted with several merged rows and columns. As such, it is not a good base file to use when importing into Tableau as there will be many null cells cluttered around if we simply drag and drop. Therefore, a basic cleanup of the original source file is far simpler and recommended versus navigating the modifications in the Data Source module of Tableau.\r\nSecondly, the data Table 5 from the MOM site is not sufficient for us to prepare a visualization that can bring out the trends stated in the lead-in statement. We will require Table 7 as well from the same site, and this was downloaded.\r\nFinally, both Table 5 and Table 7 were cleaned and copied into a new excel file named “Raw Input” as separate tabs. Main formatting work done was to unmerge the formatted rows and columns to create clean data tables as such:\r\nTable 7 cleanedTable 5 cleanedImporting the Data into Tableau\r\nAfter opening Tableau desktop, the Raw Input file was imported in. Following this, the Labor Force tab is first dragged & dropped into the logical tables panel:\r\n We immediately notice that the column headers are not captured correctly. This is because the data in the raw input file is not aligned to the first row/column. This is easily fixed by checking the “Use Data Interpreter” box on the left to obtain the following:\r\nLabor Force table - fixed row/column alignment!Next, we drag in the LFPR table. Upon doing this, Tableau will prompt us to link up the LFPR logical table with the Labor Force table that is already present in order to form the relationship. Here, we select the Age (Years) data column as the common link, and doing so will reveal the LFPR table (with a relationship established to the Labor Force table:\r\nEstablishing relationship between two logical tables - LFPR & Labor ForceNow that we have brought in the data into Tableau, it is time to structure it in a suitable manner to help us create the right visualization easily.\r\nStructuring the Data for analysis\r\nFirst, we pivot all the individual year columns by selecting them simultaneously and using the Pivot option from the small drop down on the headers:\r\n The result is a pivoted table where each row now has an age bucket, the Year and the Labor Force population pertaining to that Age bucket and year. We then re-label the newly formed columns as well as adjust the data type of the Year column to “Date”:\r\n Recall that we want to categorize the age bucket into three distinct groups that are consistent with the information in the lead-in statement. To do this, we use the drop down list on the Age(Years) column and choose the “Create Group” option:\r\n Once inside the Group editor, we highlight multiple age buckets that we want to group together, and then press “Group” button, followed by renaming the Group to a suitable name, as shown here:\r\nCreating Groups and Renaming appropriatelyAfter this, we click “Apply” and press “OK”. We now see that a column of Groups is successfully created:\r\n These groupings will help us to create the visualization very easily later on. Moving on, the same steps of Pivoting and Grouping of Age buckets and performed on the LFPR table and this gives us the result:\r\nGrouping successful for LFPR TableThe next step that is required now is to link up the “Year” and “Year (Lfpr)” columns via the matching in the Logical Table:\r\n Finally, we will need to filter away the “All” Grouping of the age buckets so that it doesn’t come in the way of creating the Visualization later. To do this, we simply click on the “Add” button under Filters in the top right and configure “All” grouping to be excluded for both tables:\r\nFilter away the “All” bucket from the tablesWe are now ready to create the visualization.\r\nCreating the Base Visualization\r\nFirst, we drag in the “Age Years (Group)” as Column, “Year” as Column and “Population (’000)” as Row to get a basic skeleton:\r\n Now, we add in the “LFPR(%)” Data as a second Y Axis into the visualization using the “Dual Axis” option:\r\n The output will look like this:\r\nFirst Dual Axis output showing both LFPR and Labor Force DataNotice that the axis are not in the intended units that we would like. Therefore, we first amend the Population Axis using a Table calculation to show the percentage of total labor force for each data point. Note that we need to use “Specific Dimensions” setting and un-check the “Year of Year” option in order to correctly calculate the % of labor force within the Age Groupings:\r\n Next, it is time to adjust the LFPR. Notice that by default, the axis values are under the “SUM” calculation. This needs to be changed to “AVERAGE” to correctly show the LFPR percentages within each age group by Year:\r\n We now see that the basic data is in place and showing correctly:\r\n It is now time to apply some Visualization fundamentals to enhance the aesthetics of the chart and make it easy to read for the audience.\r\nBeautifying the Visualization\r\nFirstly, the following are performed:\r\nX-axis is formatted to show the Year numbers horizontally.\r\nBoth X & Y Axes are formatted to increase font size & Bold.\r\nThe Age bucket labels are also formatted to increase font size & Bold.\r\nThe “Age (Years)(Group)” Label is kept hidden\r\nThe Labor Force population data is switched to a Bar chart visualization, while the LFPR data is selected as a Line chart.\r\n“Age (Years)(Group)” and “Age (Years)(LFPR)(Group)” are dragged and dropped onto the Color marks to enable color customization of all Bar groups & Lines individually.\r\nThus far, we have the following visualization:  Next, the following fine modifications are made in order to to make the visualization more appealing:\r\nThe LPFR Lines are adjusted to have line markers, and their size is adjusted lower to keep it easier on the viewer’s eyes\r\nThe LFPR line labels are turned on, but only for the ends. This will reveal the LFPR changes that is directly linked with what the lead-in statement mentions.\r\nThe Opacity of the Bars are adjusted down to 80% to soften the look. Light color borders are added.\r\nThe size of the Bars are adjusted down slightly to mitigate the overpowering look of many thick bars.\r\nAfter performing these changes, the visualization will look as such:\r\nSecond Level formatting of lines/bars completedTo finish up the visualization, the following final touches are made:\r\nThe color scheme of the bars is adjusted as close as possible to the qualitative color scale of ggplot2 hue.\r\nThe chart is given a Caption, which includes the title, a short explanation of the visualization and the data source details.\r\nFinal Visualization\r\nHere is the Final Visualization at the end of the Makeover process:\r\nFinal VisualizationKey Observations revealed by the Visualization\r\nFor the labor force aged 24-52, the Labor Force Participation rate has increased through 2009 to 2019, but their population is decreasing as a portion of the total labor force. This is most likely due to the slower influx of residents with ages 15-24 into the 24-52 group versus the outgoing population into the “55 and above” bracket.\r\nThe percentage of the labor force aged 55 and above has been steadily increasing from approximately 40% in 2009 to 50% in 2019. This is a clear indicator of an aging population.\r\nThe percentage of the labor force aged 15 to 24 has generally been slowly decreasing from ~9% in 2009 to below 8% in 2019. This points to a slowdown in the birth rate in Singapore. This would also explain the flat LFPR trend of this age group.\r\nReferences\r\nTableau Help Guide - https://www.tableau.com/support/help\r\nFundamentals of Visualization - https://clauswilke.com/dataviz/\r\nYouTube guide for Tables - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=a0rM8wAp4U0\r\nTable 5: RESIDENT LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE BY AGE AND SEX, 2009 - 2019 (JUNE) - https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-Tables2019.aspx\r\nTable 7: RESIDENT LABOUR FORCE PARTICIPATION RATE BY AGE AND SEX, 2009 - 2019 (JUNE) - https://stats.mom.gov.sg/Pages/Labour-Force-Tables2019.aspx\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",

    "contents": "\r\n1.0 Overview\r\nCorrelation coefficient is a popular statistic that use to measure the type and strength of the relationship between two variables. The values of a correlation coefficient ranges between -1.0 and 1.0. A correlation coefficient of 1 shows a perfect linear relationship between the two variables, while a -1.0 shows a perfect inverse relationship between the two variables. A correlation coeficient of 0.0 shows no linear relationship between the two variables.\r\nWhen multivariate data are used, the correlation coeficeints of the pair comparisons are displayed in a table form known as correlation matrix or scatterplot matrix.\r\nThere are three broad reasons for computing a correlation matrix.\r\nTo reveal the relationship between highdimensional variables pairwisely.\r\nTo input into other analyses. For example, people commonly use correlation matrixes as inputs for exploratory factor analysis, confirmatory factor analysis, structural equation models, and linear regression when excluding missing values pairwise.\r\nAs a diagnostic when checking other analyses. For example, with linear regression a high amount of correlations suggests that the linear regression’s estimates will be unreliable.\r\nWhen the data is large, both in terms of the number of observations and the number of variables, Corrgram tend to be used to visually explore and analyse the structure and the patterns of relations among variables. It is designed based on two main schemes:\r\nRendering the value of a correlation to depict its sign and magnitude, and\r\nReordering the variables in a correlation matrix so that “similar” variables are positioned adjacently, facilitating perception.\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, you will learn how to plot data visualisation for visualising correlation matrix with R. It consists of three main sections. First, you will learn how to create correlation matrix using pairs() of R Graphics. Next, you will learn how to plot corrgram using corrplot package of R Lastly, you will learn how to create an interactive correlation matrix using plotly R. .\r\n2.0 Installing and Launching R Packages\r\nBefore you get started, you are required:\r\nto start a new R project, and\r\nto create a new R Markdown document.\r\nNext, you will use the code chunk below to install and launch corrplot, ggpubr, plotly and tidyverse in RStudio.\r\n\r\n\r\npackages = c('ggpubr', 'tidyverse')\r\n\r\nfor(p in packages){library\r\n  if(!require(p, character.only = T)){\r\n    install.packages(p)\r\n  }\r\n  library(p, character.only = T)\r\n}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n3.0 Importing and Preparing The Data Set\r\nIn this hands-on exercise, the Wine Quality Data Set of UCI Machine Learning Repository will be used. The data set consists of 13 variables and 6497 observations. For the purpose of this exercise, we have combined the red wine and white wine data into one data file. It is called wine_quality and is in csv file format.\r\n3.1 Importing Data\r\nFirst, let us import the data into R by using read_csv() of readr package.\r\n\r\n\r\nwine <- read_csv(\"data/wine_quality.csv\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNotice that beside quality and type, the rest of the variables are numerical and continuous data type.\r\n4.0 Univariate EDA with Histogram\r\nIn the figure below, multiple histograms are plottted to reveal the distribution of the selected variables in the wine quality data sets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe code chunks used to create the data visualisation consists of two main parts. First, we will create the individual histograms using the code chunk below.\r\n\r\n\r\nfa <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `fixed acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nva <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `volatile acidity`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nca <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `citric acid`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nrs <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `residual sugar`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nch <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `chlorides`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nfSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `free sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ntSO2 <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= `total sulfur dioxide`)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\ndensity <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= density)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\npH <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= pH)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nsulphates <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= sulphates)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\nalcohol <- ggplot(data=wine, aes(x= alcohol)) +\r\n  geom_histogram(bins=20, color=\"black\", fill=\"light blue\")\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNext, the ggarrange function of ggpur package is used to group these histograms together.\r\n\r\n\r\nggarrange(fa, va, ca, rs, ch, fSO2, tSO2, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, \r\n          ncol = 4, nrow = 3)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
